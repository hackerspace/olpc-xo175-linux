	help
	  SimpleDRM can run on all systems with pre-initialized graphics
	  hardware. It uses a framebuffer that was initialized during
	  firmware boot. No page-flipping, modesetting or other advanced
	  features are available. However, other DRM drivers can be loaded
	  later and take over from SimpleDRM if they provide real hardware
	  support.

	  SimpleDRM supports "simple-framebuffer" DeviceTree objects and
	  compatible platform framebuffers.

	  If fbdev support is enabled, this driver will also provide an fbdev
	  compatibility layer.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called simpledrm.
