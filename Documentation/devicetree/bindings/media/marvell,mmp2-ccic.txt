Marvell MMP2 camera host interface

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "marvell,mmp2-ccic".
 - reg: Register base and size.
 - interrupts: The interrupt number.
 - #clock-cells: Nust be 0.

Optional properties:
 - clocks: Reference to the input clock as specified by
           Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt.
 - clock-names: Names of the clocks used; "axi" for the AXI bus interface,
                "func" for the peripheral clock and "phy" for the parallel
                video bus interface.
 - clock-output-names: Optional clock source for sensors. Shall be "mclk".

Required subnodes:
 - port: The parallel bus interface port with a single endpoint linked to
         the sensor's endpoint as described in
         Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

	camera0: camera@d420a000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mmp2-ccic";
		reg = <0xd420a000 0x800>;
		interrupts = <42>;
		clocks = <&soc_clocks MMP2_CLK_CCIC0>;
		clock-names = "axi";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-output-names = "mclk";

		port {
			camera0_0: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&ov7670_0>;
			};
		};
	};
