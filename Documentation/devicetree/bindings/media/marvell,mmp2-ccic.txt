Marvell MMP2 camera host interface

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "marvell,mmp2-ccic"
 - reg: register base and size
 - interrupts: the interrupt number
 - any required generic properties defined in video-interfaces.txt

Optional properties:
 - clocks: input clock (see clock-bindings.txt)
 - clock-output-names: should contain the name of the clock driving the
                       sensor master clock MCLK

Example:

	camera0: camera@d420a000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mmp2-ccic";
		reg = <0xd420a000 0x800>;
		interrupts = <42>;
		clocks = <&soc_clocks MMP2_CLK_CCIC0>;
		clock-names = "CCICAXICLK";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-output-names = "mclk";

		port {
			camera0_0: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&ov7670_0>;
			};
		};
	};
