Marvell Armada LCD controller
=============================

Required properties:

 - compatible: value should be "marvell,dove-lcd" or "marvell,mmp2-lcd",
   depending on the exact SoC model, along with "marvell,armada-lcdc"
 - reg: base address and size of the LCD controller
 - interrupts: single interrupt number for the LCD controller

Optional properties:

 - clocks: as described by clock-bindings.txt
 - clock-names: as described by clock-bindings.txt
	"axiclk" - axi bus clock for pixel clock
	"plldivider" - pll divider clock for pixel clock
	"ext_ref_clk0" - external clock 0 for pixel clock
	"ext_ref_clk1" - external clock 1 for pixel clock

Note: all clocks are optional but at least one must be specified.
Further clocks may be added in the future according to requirements of
different SoCs.

Required child nodes:

- port: video output port with endpoints, as described by
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt
  The endpoints can optionally specify the following property:

  - bus-width: recognized values are <12>, <16>, <18> and <24>, that
    select "rgb444", "rgb565", "rgb666" or "rgb888" pixel format
    respectively. Defaults to <24> if unspecified.

Example:

	lcd0: lcd-controller@820000 {
		compatible = "marvell,dove-lcd";
		reg = <0x820000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <47>;
		clocks = <&si5351 0>;
		clock-names = "ext_ref_clk_1";

		lcd0_port: port {
			lcd0_rgb_out: endpoint {
				bus-width = <24>;
				remote-endpoint = <&encoder_rgb_in>;
			};
		};
	};
