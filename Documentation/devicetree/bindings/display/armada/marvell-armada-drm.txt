Marvell Armada DRM master device
================================

The Marvell Armada DRM master device is a virtual device needed to list all
nodes that comprise the graphics subsystem.

Required properties:

 - compatible: value should be "marvell,dove-display-subsystem",
   "marvell,armada-display-subsystem"
 - ports: a list of phandles pointing to display interface ports of CRTC
   devices
 - memory-region: phandle to a node describing memory to be used for the
   framebuffer

Example:

	display-subsystem {
		compatible = "marvell,dove-display-subsystem",
		             "marvell,armada-display-subsystem";
		memory-region = <&display_reserved>;
		ports = <&lcd0_port>;
	};

Marvell Armada LCD controller
=============================

Required properties:

 - compatible: value should be "marvell,dove-lcd".
 - reg: base address and size of the LCD controller
 - interrupts: single interrupt number for the LCD controller

Optional properties:

 - clocks: as described by clock-bindings.txt
 - clock-names: as described by clock-bindings.txt
	"axiclk" - axi bus clock for pixel clock
	"plldivider" - pll divider clock for pixel clock
	"ext_ref_clk0" - external clock 0 for pixel clock
	"ext_ref_clk1" - external clock 1 for pixel clock

Note: all clocks are optional but at least one must be specified.
Further clocks may be added in the future according to requirements of
different SoCs.

Required child nodes:

- port: video output port with endpoints, as described by
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt

Example:

	lcd0: lcd-controller@820000 {
		compatible = "marvell,dove-lcd";
		reg = <0x820000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <47>;
		clocks = <&si5351 0>;
		clock-names = "ext_ref_clk_1";

		lcd0_port: port {
			lcd0_rgb_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&encoder_rgb_in>;
			};
		};
	};

Marvell Armada framebuffer reserved memory
==========================================

Memory set aside for allocation of Marvell Armada framebuffer objects.

Required properties:

 - compatible: value should be "marvell,dove-framebuffer",
   "marvell,armada-framebuffer".

This binding is compatible with the binding, specified in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt..

Example:

	reserved-memory {
		display_reserved: framebuffer {
			compatible = "marvell,dove-framebuffer",
			             "marvell,armada-framebuffer";
			size = <0x02000000>;
			alignment = <0x02000000>;
			no-map;
		};
	};
