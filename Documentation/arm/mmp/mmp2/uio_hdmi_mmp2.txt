Note: for Kernel 3.0.0

TODO List
---------
All basic functions and resolutions are ready. but some bugs are open:

1 Customer Philips and Panasonic report two CTS failures. Give them patch
to verify and no feedback so far. Since Vizio already pass CTS, so the issues
may be related to their platforms(except interlace mode, which they didn't test)


2 DVI adaptor fails. QA reported when connect TV via DVI adaptor, HDMI fails.

How To Work
----------
uio_driver mmap register IO to user space, and HDMI stack configure it when hpd
detected.

All HDMI logic part are done in user space HDMI stack. There is another document dedicated for
HDMI stack.

How To Use
----------
In generic linux, plug HDMI into TV, and run the static binary,

$./main_hdmi.libc

In android, plug HDMI into TV, and HDMI should be configured automatically.

Constraints
-----------
HDMI must work at CPU 800M

How To Debug
----------
This issues can mainly be divided to two catogeries:

1 HDMI stack doesn't confiure TV. 90% of the issue we can find in our lab (opposed to HDMI CTS lab)
is of this kind. it is either because EDID reading failure or hpd not generated. For the former one,
it is supposed to be fixed by Yifan's mmp2: fix twsi6 power always off issue patch; for the latter one,
it is supposed to be fixed by Yifan's mmp2: remove jitter when plug/unplug HDMI. patch.
Anyway, if you hears somebady complains of HDMI failure, firstly make sure EDID reading is successful and
hpd generated.

2 HDMI stack configure successfully but the timing or some other parameters are wrong, it is usually found in
HDMI CTS test. when meet this error, read the spec related to the failing items. if still can't find answer, you
may call DE team for help :-)
