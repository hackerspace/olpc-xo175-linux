mmp2 audio source code:

*** platform related files ***
arch/arm/mach-mmp/sram.c: manage audio sram;
arch/arm/mach-mmp/mmp2_sspa.c: manage sspa ports;
arch/arm/mach-mmp/mmp_dma.c: manage adma/mdma channels;

*** asoc related files ***
sound/soc/pxa/brownstone.c
sound/soc/pxa/mmp-pcm.c
sound/soc/pxa/mmp-sspa.c
sound/soc/codecs/wm8994.c

*** headset switch files ***
drivers/switch/switch_headset.c

to do list:
1. on mrvl-3.0, combine mmp2 audio code with mmp3 audio code together
	mmp3 use sound/soc/pxa/mmp2-squ.c and sound/soc/pxa/mmp2-sspa.c.
	mmp2 use sound/soc/pxa/mmp-pcm.c and sound/soc/pxa/mmp-sspa.c
	because their hardware design is very similar,
	so we can try to combined them together
	their platform config file is different, mmp2 is brownstone.c
	mmp3 is mmp3asoc.c,this need not changed.

2. add interface to use dmaengine(drivers/dma/dmaengine.c)
	dmaengine can use the same interface to manage ADMA, MDMA, VDMA and DMAC;
	because these three DMA's control register's design is very similar,
	we can combin them together,it can help us cut off some redundancy code.

3. combin audio sram allocator with video sram allocator together
	use lib/genalloc.c to allocate sram, include audio sram and
	video sram. now this has been done.
